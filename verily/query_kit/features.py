"""Functions for building common feature-definition queries within QueryKit.

This library implements two functions for creating queries: select() allows you
to define basic single-table queries, i.e. without joins. The more interesting
one is aggregate(), which lets you create two-stage group by/aggregate queries
by passing it a list of objects called "reducers" that define Map and Reduce
steps.

The aggregate() function takes a list of column names and reducers, and
generates a two-part query. The first part picks out the specified columns
and applies the map() query fragments from each reducer to generate some new
columns. The second step groups the table by all the input columns and applies
the reduce() step from each reducer to the columns that it defined in the first
step.

For example, the BoolCondition() reducer's Map step defines a column that is
1 for each row that meets a given condition, and 0 otherwise. The Reduce step
takes the MAX() of the values under the GROUP BY, producing a 1 if any one row
in the group met the condition and 0 otherwise.

Sample Usage:

    my_graph = template.QueryGraph('test-project', 'test-dataset')
    features.aggregate(
        my_graph, 'bool_aggregate', 'source',
        ['id', features.BoolCondition('feature1', 'my_condition')])
    query = my_graph.compile('bool_aggregate', {'source': 'test-source'})

The resulting query will GROUP BY id since this is the only non-reducer passed
to aggregate().
